Creational Design pattern
Singleton       → Only one instance (global access)
Factory Method  → Subclass decides object creation
Abstract Factory→ Family of related objects
Builder         → Step-by-step object creation
Prototype       → Copy existing object (clone)

Structural Design pattern
Adapter    →  Converts interface
Bridge     →  Decouples abstraction & implementation
Composite  →  Tree structure (whole-part)
Decorator  →  Adds behavior dynamically
Facade     →  Simplified interface to subsystem
Flyweight  →  Shares common data
Proxy      →  Controls access / lazy loading

Behavioral Design Patterns
Chain of Responsibility → Pass request along chain
Command                → Encapsulate actions as objects
Interpreter            → Define grammar & interpreter
Iterator               → Sequential access to collection
Mediator               → Central controller for communication
Memento                → Save & restore state
Observer               → Notify dependents on change
State                  → Change behavior by state
Strategy               → Swap algorithms dynamically
Template Method        → Define algorithm skeleton
Visitor                → Add operations without changing classes
