5	Intro 
	Sure. My name is Gokulraaj Manimaran, and I have around 4 years of experience as a Software Engineer on building high-performance scalable backend systems
	Currently, I’m working on the SBI Securities project, where I build real-time market data and order-execution APIs using C++, Mysql. My main focus is on delivering low-latency, secure, and reliable trading flows for end users.
	Before this, I worked at Market Simplified, where I was involved in developing high-performance backend systems for financial applications. I worked extensively on optimizing API performance, C++,Ktor framework ,Restful APIs.
	Prior to that, I worked at ADLINK, where I contributed to driver development and system-level programming.
	I started my career at Valeo, where I worked on automating test scripts and improving validation workflows,
	Across my roles, I’ve consistently worked with C++,JIRA,Git, clouding technologies like Azure.
	
	Projects
	In my current role, I’m working on the SBI Securities project, which is a trading and investment platform used by retail customers for equity, F&O, and other market segments. My primary responsibility is to build and optimize backend systems that handle real-time market data and order execution.
	One of the major challenges we faced was a CPU spike in a specific module where the request volume suddenly increased. Because of this, our RPS was getting capped and response times were degrading. I worked on optimizing that module by introducing an efficient memory-caching mechanism. This reduced redundant computations, lowered CPU usage, and significantly increased the RPS and overall throughput during peak hours.
	Apart from core trading flows, I also contributed to a major feature: the SBI Explore. I developed multiple modules including Explore, Stocks, F&O, and Mutual Funds. Within these modules, I built services for trending stocks, top-performing schemes, most-bought mutual funds, learning videos, and 52-week high/low insights. These APIs help users quickly discover market opportunities and improve engagement on the platform.
	I also focus heavily on performance tuning, optimizing API response times, improving throughput, session management, reconnections, and enhancing logs and monitoring so issues can be quickly detected during market hours.
	Overall, the project is about building a stable, secure, and high-performance trading backend for SBI Securities, ensuring smooth order execution and real-time updates for thousands of concurrent users.”
