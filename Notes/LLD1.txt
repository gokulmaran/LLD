LLD

1️⃣ Core LLD Concepts (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔹 1️⃣ Object-Oriented Principles

1️⃣ Encapsulation (Hide internal state, expose behavior)
2️⃣ Abstraction (Interfaces / abstract classes)
3️⃣ Inheritance (Reuse common behavior)
4️⃣ Polymorphism (Same interface, different behavior)

👉 Interview Question:
❓ Why composition over inheritance?

🔹 2️⃣ SOLID Principles

1️⃣ S – SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) One class, one reason to change
2️⃣ O – OCP (Open/Closed Principle) Open for extension, closed for modification
3️⃣ L – LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle) Subclasses must be substitutable
4️⃣ I – ISP (Interface Segregation Principle) Small, specific interfaces
5️⃣ D – DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) Depend on abstractions, not concretions

🔹 3️⃣ Relationships

1️⃣ IS-A → Inheritance
2️⃣ HAS-A → Composition
3️⃣ Association
Uses relationship
4️⃣ Aggregation vs Composition
Weak vs strong ownership

👉 Interview Question:
❓ Difference between aggregation and composition?

🔹 4️⃣ UML & Modeling

1️⃣ Class Diagrams
2️⃣ Sequence Diagrams
3️⃣ State Diagrams

🔹 5️⃣ Concurrency

1️⃣ Thread Safety
2️⃣ Locks / Synchronized Blocks
3️⃣ Atomic Operations
4️⃣ Idempotency

👉 Interview Question:
❓ How do you make your design thread-safe?

2️⃣ Must-Know Design Patterns (LLD Focus)


🅰️ Creational Design Patterns (Object Creation)

1️⃣ Singleton (Single instance, global access Logger, Configuration, DB Connection)
2️⃣ Factory Method (Object creation without exposing logic,  Shape, Payment, Notification)
3️⃣ Abstract Factory (Factory of related objects, UI themes, OS-based components)
4️⃣ Builder (Step-by-step object construction, Immutable objects, Config builders)
5️⃣ Prototype (Clone existing objects, Object copying, Cache optimization)


🅱️ Structural Design Patterns (Object Composition)

6️⃣ Adapter (Interface conversion, Legacy system, Third-party API)
7️⃣ Bridge (Decouple abstraction from implementation, Device + Remote, Platform independence)
8️⃣ Composite (Tree structure, part-whole hierarchy, File system, Org hierarchy)
9️⃣ Decorator (Add behavior dynamicallyPizza toppings, Logging)
🔟 Facade (Simplified interface for complex system,Library wrappers, Service layers )
1️⃣1️⃣ Flyweight (Memory optimization via shared objects, Text editor, Game objects)
1️⃣2️⃣ Proxy (Control access to object, Caching, Security, Lazy loading)

🅲 Behavioral Design Patterns (Object Interaction)

1️⃣3️⃣ Iterator (Sequential access without exposing structure, Collections traversal)
1️⃣4️⃣ Observer (One-to-many dependency,Notification system, Stock price updates)
1️⃣5️⃣ Strategy (Runtime algorithm selection, Payment methods, Rate limiter)
1️⃣6️⃣ Command (Encapsulate request as object,  Undo/Redo, Remote control)
1️⃣7️⃣ State ⭐(Behavior changes with state,Vending machine, Elevator)
1️⃣8️⃣ Template Method (Algorithm skeleton, subclass steps, Frameworks, Workflows)
1️⃣9️⃣ Visitor (Add operations without modifying objects,Tax calculation, Reporting)
2️⃣0️⃣ Mediator (Centralized communication,Chat system, Air traffic control)
2️⃣1️⃣ Memento (Capture & restore state,Undo feature, Checkpoints)
2️⃣2️⃣ Chain of Responsibility (Pass request along chain, Logging, Validation, Middleware)
