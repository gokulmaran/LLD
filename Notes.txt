Top 5 LLD questions

1. Design a Parking Lot
The classic LLD question. You're expected to model entities like ParkingLot, ParkingSpot (Compact, Large, Handicapped), Vehicle, Ticket, and a Payment system. Focus on OOP principles, spot allocation strategy, and handling multiple floors.
2
. Design a URL Shortener (like bit.ly)
Cover classes for URL mapping, encoding (Base62), expiry, redirection, and analytics. Key design decisions include the hashing strategy and handling collisions.

3. Design an Elevator System
Model Elevator, ElevatorController, Request, and Direction. The tricky part is the scheduling algorithm — SCAN (look algorithm) is commonly expected. Handle multiple elevators and edge cases like emergency stops.

4. Design a Library Management System
Entities include Book, BookItem, Member, Librarian, Loan, Reservation, and Fine. Covers search (by title/author/ISBN), checkout/return flow, and reservation queue logic.

5. Design a Chess Game / Snake and Ladders
Board games test your ability to model a Board, Piece (with polymorphism in Chess), Player, Move validation, and Game state. Chess also requires modeling special moves like castling and en passant.
