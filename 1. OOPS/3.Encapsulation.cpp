/*Encapsulation Definition: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes)
and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class. It restricts
direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components, which helps protect data integrity
and prevent unintended modifications. 

Example: A BankAccount class
encapsulates the account balance and methods for depositing and withdrawing
money, ensuring that these operations are performed through controlled
interfaces. Importance: Encapsulation provides a clear separation between an
object's internal state and the outside world. It ensures that data is only accessed
and modified through defined methods, maintaining integrity and security.

Implementation: Use private access modifiers for attributes and public
access modifiers for methods that interact with these attributes.
